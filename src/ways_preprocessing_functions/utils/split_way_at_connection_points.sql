/*
 * FUNCTION PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW:
 * =============================
 * This function splits a single linear geometry of ways into multiple 
 * segments at specified point locations. It takes a line geometry and an array of 
 * point geometries, then returns each segment between consecutive points as separate 
 * geometric objects.
 *
 * The function is essential for network segmentation operations where you need to
 * divide continuous linear features at specific intersection or connection points.
 *
 * ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:
 * 1. Convert each point to a fractional position along the input line (0.0 to 1.0)
 * 2. Iterate through points in array order
 * 3. Extract line segment from previous point to current point
 * 4. Return each valid segment as a separate geometry
 * 5. Handle the final segment from last point to line end
 *
 * INPUT PARAMETERS:
 * - line: LineString geometry to be split
 * - points: Array of Point geometries indicating where to split the line
 *
 * OUTPUT: 
 * - TABLE with 'part' column containing LineString geometries for each segment
 * - Each row represents one segment between consecutive split points
